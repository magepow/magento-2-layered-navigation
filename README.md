### Integrated Ajax technology for quick navigation
Ajax has been widely used on websites thanks to its convenience and flexibility. Ajax technology allows the website to load part of the change instead of reloading the entire page, thus saving bandwidth and shortening customer waiting times.

### User-friendly custom interface
Designing a professional layered navigation extension layout helps increase the customer experience on the page, while also increasing sales for your store. Based on the research on customer behavior on e-commerce websites, Magepow team has optimized the interface by using Sticky Sidebar. When the customer scrolls down to see the product on the page, the Sticky Side helps to immobilize the attribute category section and disappears when the customer scrolls down the footer.
